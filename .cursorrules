# Cursor Rules for Spetalier Project

## File Organization
- Use `./.temp/cursor/` directory for temporary testing files
- Never use root `.temp/` directory for test files
- Keep test files organized and separate from production temp files
- **ALWAYS** do adhoc cursor work in `./.temp/cursor/` directory
- Never create temporary files in project root

## Code Standards
- Follow lean, maintainable, and extensible architecture principles
- Use comprehensive testing for all functionality
- Fix bugs completely before moving to new features
- Document all public methods with proper docstrings
- Use type hints throughout the codebase

## Testing Standards
- **ALWAYS run tests after making major changes** - Never skip test runs
- **ALWAYS add new tests for new functionality** - Every new feature needs tests
- **ALWAYS align/update existing tests when refactoring** - Keep tests in sync with code changes
- Create comprehensive test cases for bug reproduction
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify fixes with multiple test scenarios
- Clean up test files after completion
- Keep tests aligned with code changes - if you change code, update tests accordingly

## Bug Fixing Process
1. Reproduce the bug with a minimal test case
2. Identify the root cause through systematic analysis
3. Implement a comprehensive fix
4. Test the fix thoroughly
5. Verify no regressions are introduced

## No Workarounds Policy
- **NEVER** create workarounds, bypasses, or temporary solutions
- **ALWAYS** fix the root cause properly
- **ALWAYS** make things work correctly, not "good enough"
- If dependencies are missing, install them properly
- If tests fail, fix the tests and code properly
- If imports fail, fix the import structure properly
- Do not create standalone test files to bypass conftest
- Do not skip tests or mark them as expected failures
- Do not use try/except to hide real problems
